## Description

A user can add tasks to a database and specify parameters such as task type
(Household, Work, Fun, etc.). Users can also view all tasks in a particular category, and assign one task to multiple categories.

## Setup

* Please have all Java developer tools ready, including the JDK
* You'll need Gradle or some other way to run and compile Java
* This app uses Spark and Velocity for coordinating its front end
* You may use the database included with this file. Otherwise, create your own using the following information:

**In PSQL:**

* CREATE DATABASE to_do;
* \c to_do;
* CREATE TABLE tasks (id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, description VARCHAR(50));
* CREATE TABLE categories (id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(50));
* CREATE TABLE categories_tasks (id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, category_id INT, task_id INT);
* CREATE DATABASE to_do_test WITH TEMPLATE to_do;

## Technologies Used

This app is written in Java with a little help from Bootstrap.
